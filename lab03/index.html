        <h1>CSIT211 Lab 3</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is the first webpage I created for a lab from scratch. To make sure I covered all of the requirements, <br> 
        I made my own list and crossed each one off as it was completed. I can now properly create a simple HTML <br>
        webpage using the code that I have learned in the course.</p>
        <p id="newestpara">This webpage has now been updated to include stylization! Different sections of the page will now have new <br>
        background colors, text colors, text sizes, fonts, and more. I found that using the class and ID selectors was <br>
        a bit tricky, but I kept using my resources and made sure the code was working correctly.</p>
