            If I could have any animal as a pet, it would probably be a fox. Foxes are canines that
            typically hunt rodents. In the winter, foxes walk over the snow listening for rodents
            moving around underneath them. Once it has pinpointed the sound, the fox will leap into
            the air and crash down face first through the snow to patch their prey. It is a hilarious 
            sight to behold!</p>
            <p>This image uses a file type of PNG. PNG is popular for its ability to support millions
            of colors and compress images without losing quality. I chose this image to highlight
            the beautiful colors of a fox's pelt: vivid flaming oranges, eggshell white chest fur and 
            black-tipped feet.</p>
