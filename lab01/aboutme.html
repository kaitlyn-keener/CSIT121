            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I go to CCBC, usually taking classes online. I am a full time student and part time
                worker for a government job. I live with my mom and sister, two cats (Ash & Misty), and a bearded 
                dragon (Mesa). My career goal took me some time to figure out, but is now to become a technical writer.

            <p>
                
                This semester, I am taking CSIT121, PEFT101, ENGL211, DCOM101 (7 week) and later ENGL201 (7 week). 
                It will be my final semester at CCBC before I transfer to a university in order to get a bachelor's
                degree with a major in English and a minor in IT!

            <p>

                I enjoy watching animated movies and TV shows, finding new restaurants to eat at, golfing with my 
                boyfriend, playing video games on my Switch and PC, and writing fiction. I currently own a bass guitar 
                that I want to learn how to play.
