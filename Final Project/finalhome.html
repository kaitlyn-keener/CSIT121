            <br>
            <p>This project allowed me to see all of the work I have completed over this semester. 
                I think it is important for me to see my growth, and how my knowledge and abilities 
                grew over the past few months. It is a bit of a bizarre feeling to see my websites 
                strung together in a portfolio like this, but also a good feeling, nonetheless. The 
                principles of web designs and standards I have put to use has definitely given me pride.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This course taught me a great deal about coding with HTML, CSS, and other web standards 
                like XML and JavaScript. I built upon my loose foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS 
                that I gained back in high school to make interesting and working websites on my own. 
                I learned what it really takes to build the websites that we peruse every day – which 
                is a lot! – and the effort that goes into making these websites pleasing and accessible. 
                I think next to the understanding of the standards of the web, my biggest takeaway from 
                this course is a newfound appreciation for web developers and their products.</p>
