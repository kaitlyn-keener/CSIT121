            <h2>Why Deer?</h2>
            <p> <img src="images/sunset-buck.jpg" alt="Buck standing at sunset.">
            I have seen a handful of deer in my life, often on the sides of highways or out in
            fields next to back roads. Their beauty and magnificence draws me to them. I actually
            own a real, intact deer skull with antlers given to me by my grandfather who hunts.
            I find it really cool and use it as decor in my bearded dragon's enclosure!</p>
            <p>This image uses a file type of JPG. JPG is a common format for photographs as they 
            can display over 16 million colors. I chose this image because this buck is gorgeous, 
            showing off why deer are one of my favorite animals. The landscape and the sunset glow 
            give the picture the feel of a snapshot into the serenity of nature.</p>
