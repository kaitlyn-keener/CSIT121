            <p>ARIA is a crucial web standard because it helps bridge the gap between the complex, interactive features of 
                modern websites and the needs of people who rely on assistive technologies to navigate the web. As written by
                Modzilla (2025) about ARIA, the web standard enables assistive technologies to tell the user of error messages, 
                form hints, and content updates that they otherwise would not be able to perceive. Without ARIA, 
                many interactive elements would be difficult, if not impossible, to interact with for users with disabilities.
                Screen readers are only able to describe what they are able to read and interpret from the content, and thus 
                ARIA steps in to help the human behind the screen understand the content. By making this content accessible, 
                ARIA helps ensure that people with disabilities can fully engage with the same websites and applications as 
                everyone else, contributing to a more inclusive internet.</p>
