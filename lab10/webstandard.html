            <p>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that, as defined by W3C (2024), assists 
                in the acessibility of Web content and applications for people with disabilities. ARIA is a way to provide 
                additional information about elements in a web page that may not be conveyed purely through standard HTML 
                elements. ARIA does not replace HTML or CSS - it supplements information to add extra layers of meaning for
                accessibility. ARIA is helpful for complex, interactive elements like custom forms, dropdown menus, modals, 
                and dynamic content updates, where HTML on its own may not provide enough information for assistive technologies. 
                As web applications become more complex, ARIA enables web developers to maintain accessibility standards, ensuring 
                that the web remains usable for everyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>
