            <p>ARIA is used in conjunction with HTML. Specific attributes are added to HTML elements to define roles, states, 
                and properties. This allows assistive technologies to interpret these elements and send that feedback to the 
                user. An article on ARIA by WebAIM (2020) summarizes the "five rules of ARIA", which describes how ARIA should 
                be used to best support user accessibility. The first rule states that ARIA should not be used if an HTML element 
                or attribute can obtain the same outcome. This is to reduce the risk of problems that may come from using ARIA 
                as a substitute in this instance. The second rule, which goes hand-in-hand with the first rule, states that 
                ARIA should not be added to HTML elements that can already convey their meaning to accessibility tools. This is
                to make sure that the semantics of an element are not unnecessarily lost. The third rule states that there must 
                be keyboard interactivity for all ARIA controls. This allows for users to not need the use of mouse input, which
                can be difficult or impossible for people with poor fine motor skills. The fourth rule states that interactive controls 
                cannot be hidden. This is so that important elements are not glossed over by assistive tools. The fifth rule states 
                that accessible names must be given to all interactive elements. This is to ensure that assistive technology can 
                properly interpret the element.</p>
